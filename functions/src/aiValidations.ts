Note: there are some new brand names to learn: TheBuildersDAO, NOX Gallery, SheFi, NFC Lisbon, Consensys, Crowdmuse. It is likely that if a word is capitalized it is the Brand name. The brand name could be referred to by a mention using the @ decorator, such as @shefi or @nike (describing the shefi brand or nike brand). It could be in a hashtag, such as #happySheFi, or with a / in front such as /shefi. If you see @proofof, that is a special tag and is not the brandname. If the text contains @TheBuildersDao or #ProofofBuilders then the brand is TheBuildersDao.`

The DESCRIPTION may mention a BRAND "${brandName}" that they claim is visible in the IMAGE. Your task is to determine whether the user's claim is true and therefore VALID, or not true and so therefore NOT VALID. You may not recognize the Brand name or the logos, as they are very new brands. If so, learn the new brand.

                Here is the original user DESCRIPTION: "${message}"
                
                For this IMAGE, think through what is the full list of every piece of clothing, artwork, apparel, text, visible signage, logos, and items in the image.
                
                Some Special new brands to note:
                - NOX Gallery - paintings, artwork, digital images, stickers, shirts
                - TheBuildersDao - has shiny stickers, clothing, art gallery, photos, artwork, paintings. They are working with these artists, who may or may not be mentioned with an image of a work of art: Tormius, Lele Gastini, Fabiola Sangineto, The Social Trauma, Amastasia, Stijn Stragier, Cotama, RedruM, Flavio Acri, Cotama, Caperucita la m√°s roja, Yukari YAMINO, Samanta, BloomingVisions, Nadobroart, Anna Dart, Roger Haus, mochataro. If any of those names are mentioned, reply with "VALID - TheBuildersDAO x [artist name]"
                - the SheFi brand has a logo that says SheFi and has products such as blue bucket hats, beanies, and shirts.
                - Crowdmuse
                - Web3District
                
                You need to answer TRUE or FALSE to each of the two following questions:
                1) Is the user's DESCRIPTION of the IMAGE generally correct, and without any false statements? For example, if they describe a swimsuit but the image contains a man in a business suit, this would be FALSE.
                2) Is the BRAND "${brandName}" name or logo visible and present in the image? Note: If the brand name or logo is not directly visible or legible, but it could plausibly be correct based on the type of items, clothing, artwork or location setting, then trust the user and answer TRUE.
                
                Your response should be one of the two options:
                1. "NOT VALID - [reason]"
                2. "VALID - [BRAND name]@annadart_artist
                
                Substitute the appropriate responses into the brackets. Respond with NOT VALID if the brand listed is definitely not in the image, because of [reason].
                
                EXAMPLES:
                - If the image has DESCRIPTION of the brand Ray-Ban, and there are no sunglasses visible in the image, then respond "NOT VALID - no Ray-Ban sunglasses visible".
                - If the image has the claim of the brand Ray-Ban, and there are sunglasses visible in the image but hard to tell what brand they are, which could be because there is no brand label visible or the item is small, then respond with "VALID - Ray-Ban, sunglasses".
                - If the DESCRIPTION says a swimsuit but the image contains a jacket, this would be "NOT VALID - image does not match description".`},
                { type: 'image_url', image_url: { url: imageUrl } }
            ],
        }]
    });

    if (typeof brandValidation !== 'string' || (typeof brandValidation === 'string' && brandValidation.includes('NOT VALID'))) {
        return null;
    }
